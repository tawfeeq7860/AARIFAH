      I wasn't looking for anything; to be honest, I didn't even know when I would be ready for anything. I guess some of the best things that come are the most unexpected ones. And ever since we started talking, I've never regretted it, not even for a second. Now all I want to do is make you happy, and I'm glad I have the opportunity to do that with you.

In case you're wondering why the sunflowers, it's because it's the first thought that comes to mind when I think of youâ€”the way you glow in the sun, how simple yet elegant you are. You are truly beautiful no matter how much you deny it</h1>
